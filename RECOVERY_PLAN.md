## üéØ **WHAT WE NEED TO RESTORE**

### **The Original Vision:**
- **Photo Inspiration Panel** (30% left) ‚Üí triggers mathematical thinking
- **Interactive Canvas** (70% right) ‚Üí rich manipulative + drawing environment
- **Ambient AI Tutor** ‚Üí Pi powered by Gemini Live, observing and guiding
- **Teacher Dashboard** ‚Üí separate route for insights and reasoning visualization

### **Key User Flows We Broke:**
1. **Student opens app** ‚Üí sees inspiring photo ‚Üí starts mathematical exploration
2. **Student clicks "+" button** ‚Üí sees grid of manipulatives ‚Üí selects fraction bar
3. **Student switches to pencil mode** ‚Üí draws connections between widgets
4. **Student says "add a number line"** ‚Üí voice control adds widget to canvas
5. **Pi observes silently** ‚Üí provides gentle guidance when needed
6. **Teacher views dashboard** ‚Üí sees reasoning maps and student progress

## üö® **WHAT NOT TO DO AGAIN**

1. **Never replace working components** - Enhance, don't destroy
2. **Don't chase technical novelty** - Educational value comes first
3. **Don't break the widget system** - It's the core of our platform
4. **Don't ignore the dual-mode canvas** - Students need both interaction modes
5. **Don't remove the hand-drawn aesthetic** - It reduces math anxiety
6. **Don't make Pi intrusive** - Ambient guidance only
7. **Don't complicate the student interface** - Keep it clean and focused

---

## üìû **COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL**

- **Before each phase:** Get user approval to proceed
- **During implementation:** Provide progress updates
- **After each component:** Test and demonstrate functionality
- **If issues arise:** Stop, assess, and get guidance
- **When complete:** Full demonstration and user acceptance

---

**Remember: We're rebuilding a sophisticated educational platform that took significant time and thought to create. Every widget, every interaction, every design decision had educational purpose. Our job is to restore that magic and enhance it with Gemini Live, not replace it.**

**Let's get our widgets back! üßÆüìèüìä**
